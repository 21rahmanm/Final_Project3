<p> Fortnite Battle Royale was released on September 26, 2017. Ever since the release of Fortnite 
it has blown up to be the most popular game on the market. Fortnite is a third person game. When you 
que up into a game you have one objective. That is to get a Victory Royale. In order to get the win you 
must go up against 99 other players. Unlike Fortnite's counter part PUBG you have to ability to harvest 
resources by chopping done trees, taking apart houses, breaking containers, breaking cars/trucks and Loot 
Llamas. Loot Llamas are similar to supply drops. They drop 200 wood, 200 brick and 200 metal. It also drops 
various types of ammo. There are only 3 Loot Llamas per game and they spawn in the strangest locations. 
The cool thing about Loot Llamas are that they spawn close together. Guns in Fortnite spawn in 5 different 
variants. Grey, Green, Blue, Purple and Gold. Each week Fortnite also comes out with LTM'S(Limited Time Mode). 
These are different game modes to add a twist and to make Fortnite more fun. Some modes include Solid Gold, all 
the weapons are gold, Sniper Shootout, Blitz, the storm is faster making a faster game, High Explosive, only 
explosive weapons allowed in this game mode, Teams of 20, in this mode there are 5 teams of 20, 50 v 50, in this 
mode 50 players vs 50 other players to get the victory royale. Fortnite Battle Royale is still in beta and Epic, 
the developers of Fortnite, are trying to make the game better each and every day by adding buffs to weapons or by 
decreasing the damage of some weapons to make the game more fair. </p>
