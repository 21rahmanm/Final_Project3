 <!--Paragraph--> 
<p>
Nick Eh 30 is the best builder on Fortnite Battle Royale. The speed of how he builds confuses 
and scares the enemies to the point where they do stupid things like fall off of their structures. 
At the end of a game if Nick is facing a noob than he will try to make some epic play such as making a
trap base or sky base, he might try to no scope some one with a sniper to make some epic play.
