 Dark aka Dakotaz is the best Sniper in Fortnite Battle Royale. He is known for his insane snipes and trickshots.
 Unlike alot of streamers Dakotaz does not use face cam which is surprising because a lot of people like looking at 
 who they are watching. Dakotaz has probable more Sniper kills than most people have wins.
